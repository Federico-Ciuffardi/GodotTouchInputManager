# Godot Touch Input Manager
Godot Touch Input Manager (GDTIM) is an asset that improves touch input support (includes [new gestures](#supported-gestures)) in the Godot game engine. You just need to autoload a script and it will start analyzing the touch input. When a gesture is detected a Custom Input Event corresponding to the detected gesture will be created and [fed up](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_input.html#class-input-method-parse-input-event) to the Godot built in Input Event system so it triggers functions like [`_input(InputEvent event)`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html#class-node-method-input). There is also a signal for each gesture if you prefer using signals to the aforementioned. 

This asset was ported to be added to Godot and is now a milestone for version 4.0 ([PR](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/36953)).

## How to use
* Download the latest release from https://github.com/Federico-Ciuffardi/Godot-Touch-Input-Manager/releases
* Extract the downloaded *.zip* file somewhere in you project
* Locate the extracted `InputManager.gd`, and [Autoload](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.4/tutorials/scripting/singletons_autoload.html) it.
* Done! Now you can use the GodotTouchInputManager's [signals and its Custom Input Events](#supported-gestures).

When one of these gestures is detected a Custom Input Event corresponding to the detected gesture will be created and [fed up](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_input.html#class-input-method-parse-input-event) to the Godot built in Input Event system so it triggers functions like [`_input(InputEvent event)`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html#class-node-method-input).

### Gesture emulation

The gestures can be triggered by named [input actions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/inputs/input_examples.html#inputmap) with specific names. If the input
action does not exists there is a default event that will trigger the gesture.

The following table shows the default event and the names of the input actions
that will trigger each of the gestures that can be emulated.

| Gesture name                       | Input action name       | Default event |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| Single touch                       | single_touch            | **\***        |

| Multiple finger swipe (left-up)    | multi_swipe_up_left     | u             |

**\*** There are two options to enable single finger gestures:
1. Go to **Project > Project Settings > General > Input Devices > Pointing**
   and turn on *Emulate Touch From Mouse* to emulate a single finger touch with
   the left click. 
2. Go to **Project > Project Settings > General > Input Devices > Pointing**
   and turn off both *Emulate Touch From Mouse* and *Emulate Mouse From Touch*.
   Then set an input action called `single_touch`.
